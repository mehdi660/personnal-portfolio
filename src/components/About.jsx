          Hello! My name is Mehdi, I'm 21 years old, and I was born on
          26/09/2002 in Belfort (France). Since September 2022, I've started
          coding, and since then, I haven't stopped. Coding, for me, is a form
          of relaxation that allows me to unwind and think about something else,
          much like sports or video games. I have a passion for creating new
          things, solving problems, and the satisfaction of seeing the results
          of my creations.
        </p>

    </section>
